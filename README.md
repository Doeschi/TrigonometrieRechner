# TrigonometrieRechner
Calculating and drawing sinus and cosinus in the unity circle. Created with [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js)

The radiobutton "Sinus" will show the triangle with the same sinus value, the "Cosinus" button will show the triangle with the same cosinus value.
The inputfields show the angle of triangles. If the "Cosinus" or "Sinus" radiobutten is checked, it will show the angles of both possible triangles.
At the bottom are the actual values of sinus, cosinus and tanges shown.
